- General Java-to-Rust differences.
    `Option`, `Box`, `Rc<RefCell>`, `Result` instead of throwing,
    and who knows what just to emulate OOP in Rust.
    Ugly error reporting is ugly but works.
- No new syntax node for logical expr. It got stuffed into binary expr.
- TODO: Change Environment in interpreter into vec of envs;
    No `enclosing` field, the enclosing env is simple up in stack.
    In block stmt visitor instead of taking Rc, take index of prev env.
- TODO: Handle quote escaping ("\"") inside strings
- TODO: Add break keyword
